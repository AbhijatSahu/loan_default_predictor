Loan Default Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan applicant will default on their loan using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various financial and demographic features, the model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple features related to borrowers, including:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, employment status, etc.

Financial History: Credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio.

Loan Details: Loan amount, interest rate, repayment history.

Other Relevant Factors: Previous defaults, number of dependents, etc.

Approach

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and feature importance.

Model Selection: Training multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation: Using Mean absolute Error

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.

Results

The best-performing model achieved the following metrics:

Mean absolute Error - 1.1318150631204968

These results indicate a strong predictive performance, balancing precision and recall effectively.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting loan defaults. The model can help financial institutions assess risk more accurately and make better lending decisions. Future improvements could include incorporating additional financial indicators and refining feature engineering techniques.
